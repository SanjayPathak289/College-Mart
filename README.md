While I understand the initial request was to create a "Movie Explorer" web application, I would like to propose an alternative project that I have recently made, titled "College Mart".\
This is a web application where users can buy or sell their products, also integrated chatting system and filters and I believe it effectively showcases my full-stack development skills.\
Given the scope and complexity of "College Mart," I believe it provides a comprehensive demonstration of my abilities in full-stack development, including problem-solving, technical skills, and project management.\
This project not only meets but exceeds the requirements initially set out for the "Movie Explorer" project.

Frontend Development: Utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interfaces.\
Backend Development: Implementing server-side logic with Node.js and Express, ensuring robust handling of user requests and data processing.\
Database Management: Using MongoDB to manage and retrieve data efficiently, demonstrating my ability to work with NoSQL databases.\
Authentication and Security: Implementing user authentication and authorization using JWT, ensuring secure access to user data and transactions.\
RESTful API: Creating and consuming RESTful APIs to handle various operations such as user registration, product listing.
